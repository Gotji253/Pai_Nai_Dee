VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG=""

# Initial Auth Token (Optional - for specific auth flows if provided by your backend/platform)
# If you don't use an initial custom token, you can leave this blank or remove it.
# The FirebaseContext.js will fall back to anonymous sign-in if this is not set.
VITE_INITIAL_AUTH_TOKEN=""

# App ID (if you want to make it configurable via .env)
# The FirebaseContext.js currently has a fallback if this is not set.
